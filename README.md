# Degrees

A BFS search algorithm that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are. Since it uses BFS, the algorithm is granted to find the shortest path.
This project is part of the CS50's Introduction to AI course's assignments. 

# Running the project

To get up and running straigth away:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the root folder.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
            $ py degrees.py
```
4. That's it! Just type the name of the actors and you'll get the shortest path between them!
